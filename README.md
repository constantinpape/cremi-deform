Introduce distortions to labeled volumes

## Build instructions:

Clone the repository for `bigcat`

* https://github.com/saalfeldlab/bigcat.git

and build it with

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This is the only 'inofficial' dependency.

Now you can build a fat jar with

```bash
mvn clean package
```

to be found in `targets`.
